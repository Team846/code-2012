/*
 * Authors: Tony Peng & Raphael Chang
 * As of February 6th, 8:11 AM, this code properly detects the edge of the key
 *
 * TO-DO:
 * - Get distance from edge
 * - Improve Hough Transform
 * 
 * CURRENT STATUS:
 * - Sobel is working!
 * - Hough Transform is working, but accuracy could be improved a bit. :|
